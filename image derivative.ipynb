    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "An image can be represented as a mapping : $f(x,y)$, in which $(x,y)$ defines coordinates and $f(x,y)$ for intensity value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First- and Second Order Derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(x+\\Delta x,y)$ expand as Taylor series:\n",
    "### $f(x+\\Delta x,y) = f(x,y)+\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\Delta x+ o(\\|\\Delta x\\|)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the linear terms and let $\\Delta x$ be 1,we will get:\n",
    "### $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=f(x+1,y)-f(x,y)$.\n",
    "That's the first order derivative in x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking derivative is a linear transformation.To calculate the second order derivative with respect to $x$,we can apply $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ on $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ again:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}} = f(x+2,y)-f(x+1,y)-f(x+1,y)+f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute $x$ for $x+1$ because we want the derivative at $x$,we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}} = f(x+1,y)+f(x-1,y)-2f(x,y)$. \n",
    "That's the second order derivative in x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same approach, we can calculate the first- and second order derivative in y direction, and the mixed partial derviative with respect to  $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can conclude the derivatives talked above as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Order Derivative:\n",
    "    - in x direction:$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=f(x+1,y)-f(x,y)$\n",

    "    - in y direction:$\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y^{2}} = f(x,y+1)+f(x,y-1)-2f(x,y)$\n",

    "    - mixed partial:$\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x \\partial y}=f(x+1,y+1)+f(x,y)-f(x+1,y)-f(x,y+1)$\n",

    "### Hessian Matrix\n",
    "\n",
